# Circles

A meditative musical game created in p5.js.

### Instructions

**Circles** runs in the browser on desktop and mobile devices. Click and drag/tap and drag anywhere on the screen to draw a circle. The circle's position on the longest axis determines pitch. The circle's size determines LFO rate which modulates filter cutoff. A maximum of 5 circles can exist simultaneously. When a sixth circle is drawn, the oldest circle will disappear. That's all!

### TO DO

- [ ] Add browser detection for mobile devices
- [ ] Make text device specific (desktop/mobile)
- [ ] Change circle oscillation from linear to exponential
